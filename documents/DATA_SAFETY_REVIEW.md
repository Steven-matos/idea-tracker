- **Type Checking**: Ensures correct data types
- **Format Validation**: Validates data formats (colors, dates, etc.)

### **Storage Safety**
- **Atomic Operations**: Prevents partial data writes
- **Backup Creation**: Always creates backup before modification
- **Validation Pipeline**: Multi-step validation before storage
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic recovery from failures

### **Data Consistency**
